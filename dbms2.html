       <h3>What is Data?</h3>
       <p>Data is a collection of a distinct small unit of information. It can be used in a variety of forms like text, numbers, media, bytes, etc. it can be stored in pieces of paper or electronic memory, etc.

        Word 'Data' is originated from the word 'datum' that means 'single piece of information.' It is plural of the word datum.
        
        In computing, Data is information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing. Data is interchangeable.</p>
        <h3>What is Database?</h3>
        <p>A database is an organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.
           <br>
            You can organize data into tables, rows, columns, and index it to make it easier to find relevant information.
            <br>
            Database handlers create a database in such a way that only one set of software program provides access of data to all the users.
            <br>
            The main purpose of the database is to operate a large amount of information by storing, retrieving, and managing data.
            <br>
            There are many dynamic websites on the World Wide Web nowadays which are handled through databases. For example, a model that checks the availability of rooms in a hotel. It is an example of a dynamic website that uses a database.
            <br>
            There are many databases available like MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, MongoDB, Informix, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.
            <br>
            Modern databases are managed by the database management system (DBMS).
            <br>
            SQL or Structured Query Language is used to operate on the data stored in a database. SQL depends on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
            <br>
            A cylindrical structure is used to display the image of a database.</p>
            <h3>The Evolution</h3>
            <h4>File-Based</h4>
            <p>1968 was the year when File-Based database were introduced. In file-based databases, data was maintained in a flat file. Though files have many advantages, there are several limitations.

                One of the major advantages is that the file system has various access methods, e.g., sequential, indexed, and random.
                
                It requires extensive programming in a third-generation language such as COBOL, BASIC.</p>
                <h4>Hierarchical Data Model</h4>
                <p>1968-1980 was the era of the Hierarchical Database. Prominent hierarchical database model was IBM's first DBMS. It was called IMS (Information Management System).

                    In this model, files are related in a parent/child manner.
                    
                    Below diagram represents Hierarchical Data Model. Small circle represents objects.</p>
