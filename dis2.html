      <h3>Introduction of Sets</h3>
      <p>A set is defined as a collection of distinct objects of the same type or class of objects. The purposes of a set are called elements or members of the set. An object can be numbers, alphabets, names, etc.<br>Examples of sets are:</p>
      <ol>
     <li>A set of rivers of India.</li>
     <li>A set of vowels.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We broadly denote a set by the capital letter A, B, C, etc. while the fundamentals of the set by small letter a, b, x, y, etc.

        If A is a set, and a is one of the elements of A, then we denote it as a ∈ A. Here the symbol ∈ means -"Element of."</p>
        <h3>Sets Representation:</h3>
        <p>Sets are represented in two forms:-</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>roster or tabular form:</strong>  In this form of representation we list all the elements of the set within braces { } and separate them by commas.
            <br>
                <strong>Example:</strong> If A= set of all odd numbers less then 10 then in the roster from it can be expressed as A={ 1,3,5,7,9}.</li>
            <li><strong>Builder form:</strong> Builder form: In this form of representation we list the properties fulfilled by all the elements of the set. We note as {x: x satisfies properties P}. and read as 'the set of those entire x such that each x has properties P.'
                <br>
              <strong>  Example:</strong>   If B= {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}, then the set builder representation will be: B={x: x=2n, where n ∈ N and 1≤ n ≥5}</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cardinality of a Sets:</h3>
        <p>The total number of unique elements in the set is called the cardinality of the set. The cardinality of the countably infinite set is countably infinite.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Let P = {k, l, m, n}<br>
                The cardinality of the set P is 4.</li>
                <li>2. Let A is the set of all non-negative even integers, i.e.<br>
                    A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10......}.</li>
        </ol>
