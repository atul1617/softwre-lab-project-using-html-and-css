         <h1>Data Structures Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Data Structures (DS) tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Data Structure.
             Our Data Structure tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.
                Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.
              Our Data Structure tutorial includes all topics of Data Structure such as Array,
             Pointer, Structure, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Searching, Sorting, Programs, etc.</p>
    <h3>What is Data Structure?</h3>
    <p>The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. 
        There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, 
        i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let's see the different types of data structures
        The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc.
         It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.
        To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, 
        and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.</p>
        <h3>types of Data Structure</h3>
        <p>There are two types of data structures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Primitive data structure</li>
            <li>Non-primitive data structure</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Primitive Data structure</h3>
        <p>The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.</p>
        <h3>Non-Primitive Data structure</h3>
        <p>The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linear data structure</li>
            <li>Non-linear data structure</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Linear Data Structure</h3>
        <p>The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.</p>
        <p><strong>When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a non-linear data structure. The best example is trees and graphs. In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.</strong>We will discuss the above data structures in brief in the coming topics. Now, we will see the common operations that we can perform on these data structures.</p>
